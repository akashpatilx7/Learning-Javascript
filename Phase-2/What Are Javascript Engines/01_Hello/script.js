Node.js is an implementation of a Javascript Engine which can convert the stand-alone Javascript code into output-able code so that the user does not always have to attach the Javascript code into a HTML File just to reload/ process it.

Once the user installs Node.js on the local system, a separate HTML File is no longer needed to run a Javascript File !
