Multiline (Block) Comments :
Javascript multiline comments, also known as block comments, start with a forward slash followed by an asterisk and end with an asterisk followed by a forward slash. They do not require a comment delimiter character on every line and may contain newlines.


A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters for specifying the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text, mathematical expressions or other data streams. An example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a field delimiter in a sequence of comma-separated values.



******------ NOTES ------******
  
  
With the launch of NODEJS, the use of JAVASCRIPT in BACKEND WEB DEVELOPEMENT (along with the FRONT END WEB DEVELOPEMENT) has increased drastically. This increased the popularity of JAVASCRIPT as a whole.

JAVASCRIPT can be also be simply ran in your WEB BROWSER. Scripts can be executed in the browser itself . (No need to install EXTERNAl PROGRAM) 

SCRIPT TAG is used to write JAVASCRIPT.

JAVASCRIPT WEB PAGE main JAAN daalti hain ! (LOGIC FOR THE FRONT END WITHOUT GOING TO THE SERVER)

CONSOLE (which opens on clicking inspect by right clicking on the web browser) helps to make changes in the GOOGLE.COM website.



*** DEEP DIVE INTO JAVASCRIPT ***


= JavaScript was initially designed for making pages " alive ".
= Scripts can be executed in the browser itself . (No need to install EXTERNAl PROGRAM)
= JavaScript and Java are different programming languages.
= It can be executed on the browser as well as the server.
= JavaScript is a safe language when used in browser. (Data chori vagaira hone ka dar nahi rehta !)
= There are languages that get " transpiled " to JavaScript Eg : Coffeescript, Typescript, etc



****** DEFINITIONS ******

DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL) : MANIPULATING THE INFORMATION OF YOUR WEB PAGE WHICH WAS WRITTEN/ CREATED BY HTML, USING JAVASCRIPT, IS KNOWN AS DOM. 

       STANDARD DEFINITION : The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.


       
****** FUNCTIONS ******

         
#ALERT FUNCTION (alert): shows Alerts/ Outputs (ALERT NOTIFICATIONS)

#CONSOLE.LOG (console.log): shows Alerts/ Outputs in console 

#document.querySelector : To target a particular class, in Javascript, we use "document.querySelector"

#.click() : Used to click on a particular entity

#ID : Accessing an element by ID is easier. To access an element using ID, we use "document.getElementById"

document.write : Used to write on the document directly. (Making direct changes in the document itself)



*** JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE API (API : APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE) *** 
console.log("This is used to output any given text inside the commas.")

console.warn("This is a WARNING");

console.error("This is an ERROR");

console.clear("This is used to clear the console, totally.")

console.assert("This is an ASSERTION STATEMENT.")


* WAYS TO PRINT IN JAVASCRIPT 

1/ console.log("Hello World");
2/ alert("Hello World");
3/ document.write("This function is used to write on the DOCUMENT directly without the use of console.log")



****** GENERAL ******

SHORTCUT TO OPEN CONSOLE (in web browser) : Ctrl + Shift + i

* CONSOLE can also be used as a simple calculator.
* Javascript is used to develop CHROME EXTENSIONS.
* Semicolon lagao, na lagao, koi farak nahi padta.

Javascript is used in both FRONTEND & BACKEND WEB DEVELOPEMENT.

* . ----> CLASS (IDENTIFIER FOR MORE THAN 1 ELEMENTS)
  # ----> ID (IDENTIFIER)

*** CLASS 1 se jyada elements main ho sakti hain, ID sirf 1 element main hi hogi !

  

****** NOTE ******


Inbrowser Javascript is CLIENT-SIDED JAVASCRIPT.

If Javascript is not used while making a website, the user is not much able to interact with the developed website.

HTML       ----> MUST TO DESIGN A WEBSITE
CSS        ----> DESIGNING
JAVASCRIPT ----> CLIENT-SIDE SCRIPTING

WEB SERVER : Is a computer which computes the queries, processes it and returns HTML,CSS & Javascript in response. For processing, various languages can be used. Eg : PHP, Python + Django, Javascript, etc. (NODEJS : If Javascript is to be ran outside of the Browser, NODEJS has to used. Else, for running inside the Browser, Only Javascript is sufficient.)

* Javascript is written just before the CLOSING OF THE BODY TAG.
* Alerts are not used in MODERN JAVASCRIPT nowadays.
